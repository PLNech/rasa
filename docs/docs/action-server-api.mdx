The [action server](action-server.mdx) must implement an endpoint with the spec below to receive HTTP `POST` requests from the Rasa Server.
The action server can serve any other additional endpoints, but the Rasa server will only send
requests to the one specified in 
`endpoints.yml`.

For a Rasa SDK action server running locally, the endpoint would look like this:

```yaml-rasa
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://action-server:5055/webhook"
```

The Rasa server will send a `POST` request to this endpoint
 and will expect a response in the format specified below.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import Redoc from '@site/src/components/redoc';


<Redoc specUrl={useBaseUrl("/spec/action-server.yml")} />
