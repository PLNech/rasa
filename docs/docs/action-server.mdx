Custom actions are run by the action server. 
When your assistant predicts a custom action, the Rasa server sends 
a `POST` request to the action server with a json payload including
the name of the predicted action,
the conversation ID, the contents of the tracker and the contents of the domain.

When the action server finishes running a custom action, it returns a json payload
of [responses](responses.mdx) and [events](events.mdx). The Rasa server then returns
the responses to the user and adds the events
to the conversation tracker. 

See the [action server API spec](action-server-api.mdx) for details of the payload sent to the action server
and the expected response format.
See the [documentation for events](events.mdx) for details
about event types that can be returned.


## SDKs for Custom Actions

### Rasa SDK (Python)

The [Rasa SDK]() is a Python SDK for running custom actions. It provides
the required endpoint and the base `Action` class, as well as methods for interacting
with the tracker and sending messages in specific formats (e.g. images, buttons, custom payloads for 
specific messaging channels). If you don't yet have an action server and don't need it
to be in a language other than Python, using the Rasa SDK will be the easiest way
to get started.
See the [docs for the Rasa SDK]() for more details.

### SDKs in Other Languages

If you have legacy code or existing business logic in a language 
other than Python, you may not want to use the Rasa SDK. In this case you can write
your own action server in any language you want. The only requirement
for the action server is that it provide an endpoint which accepts HTTP `POST` requests
from the Rasa server and returns a list of [events](events.mdx). 
See the [page on custom actions]() for details about the information that will be passed
to the action server and what can be done with it.
